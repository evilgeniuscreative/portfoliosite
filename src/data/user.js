			"I can't even remember how many projects I've worked on over the years for private clients or companies or just for fun. But I always learn a lot of new skills and I love it. Each project is a chance to learn something new about technology, design, people, business, and more. Over the years, I've learned everything from the most basic HTML and CSS to arcane and nearly archaic languages like Freemarker, to battleship size CMSs like Khoros Community or Adobe AEM, to cutting edge web dev modern stacks like React, and Vue, with or without Typescript.",
